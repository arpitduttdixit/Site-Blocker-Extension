# Implementation Summary: Block & Redirect Extension

## What Was Added

### 1. Data Structure Changes
- Extended the existing `{pattern, blockUntil}` structure to `{pattern, blockUntil, action, redirectUrl}`
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing blocked sites
- Added proper validation for redirect URLs

### 2. UI Improvements
- Added action selection dropdown (Block/Redirect)
- Added conditional redirect URL input field that shows/hides based on action
- Improved styling with better layout and visual hierarchy
- Updated section title from "Currently blocked" to "Current Rules"
- Enhanced rule display to show action type and redirect target

### 3. Background Script Updates
- Modified `patternsToRules()` to `rulesToDynamicRules()` to handle both block and redirect actions
- Updated rule creation to use Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API for both blocking and redirecting
- Ensured all data migration functions handle the new structure

### 4. Popup Logic Enhancements
- Updated `addPattern()` function to handle both actions
- Added URL validation with automatic protocol addition
- Improved form handling and input clearing
- Enhanced visual feedback for different rule types

## Key Features

### Block Functionality (Existing)
- Blocks navigation to specified URLs
- Shows "BLOCK" label in red
- Works exactly as before

### Redirect Functionality (New)
- Redirects navigation from source URL to target URL
- Shows "REDIRECT â†’ target" label in blue
- Validates redirect URLs and adds https:// if missing
- Supports both full URLs and domain names

### UI/UX Improvements
- Clean, organized input form with proper labels
- Conditional fields that show/hide based on selection
- Better visual distinction between block and redirect rules
- Maintained the existing anime-style design aesthetic

## Technical Implementation

### Chrome APIs Used
- `declarativeNetRequest` for both block and redirect rules
- `storage.sync` for data persistence
- Proper rule priority and resource type handling

### Data Flow
1. User selects action type and enters URLs
2. Frontend validates input and creates rule object
3. Rule object sent to background script
4. Background script converts to Chrome declarativeNetRequest format
5. Rules applied immediately without page reload

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing blocked sites automatically converted to new format
- All existing functionality preserved
- Quick-add buttons continue to work for blocking
- Expiry functionality works with both rule types
